# animal-picker
Animal picker is a HackViolet 2023 program created to raise awareness of increasing habitat destruction.

Using AI/ML libraries, the backend program finds the visitor’s emotions. An image of the visitor’s favorite animal with the same emotions is subsequently generated, along with 
general information about it.
